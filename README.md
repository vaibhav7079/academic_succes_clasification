DATA INFORMATION

For what purpose was the dataset created?

The dataset was created in a project that aims to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. 

The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment – academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. 

The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course. 

Who funded the creation of the dataset?

This dataset is supported by program SATDAP - Capacitação da Administração Pública under grant POCI-05-5762-FSE-000191, Portugal.

What do the instances in this dataset represent?

Each instance is a student

Are there recommended data splits?

The dataset was used, in our project, with a data split of 70% for training and 30% for test.

Was there any data preprocessing performed?

We performed a rigorous data preprocessing to handle data from anomalies, unexplainable outliers, and missing values.
